## App goals:

* For each shortened url, it should store a counter for the number of
  redirections and for each visit and it should store the IP address. It should
  perform well and not have any timeouts or slow requests
* Optional Generate statistics by countries based off of IPs. E.g. 10% users
  are from France, other 90% from India.
* Optional Generate all statistics by by total redirections and unique
  redirections
* Optional It should be able to handle a heavy load of traffic at 10,000,000
  users per day
