## What went well?

## What didn't go well?

Nothing in particular, I had to deal with some very small deprecations in Rails
since this is my first project on Rails 6.

## If you had more time to work on this,
  * Use a more elegant state handling library like Redux
  * Add proper specs for the features
  * Put stats inside an authenticated environment
